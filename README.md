# Penguin Species Classification System
 In this project, I built a penguin species classification system using RandomForestClassifier from scikit-learn , leveraging the Palmer Penguins dataset for ecological insights. I implemented data preprocessing with pandas , including one-hot encoding for categorical features and target mapping, and deployed the model via a Streamlit -based web app for user-friendly predictions. The solution demonstrates expertise in data-driven decision-making, model deployment, and integration of machine learning into accessible tools, which can benefit businesses in biodiversity research, conservation planning, or educational platforms by automating species identification and enabling actionable ecological analysis. Tools & Libraries: • Python : Core logic, preprocessing, and modeling. • scikit-learn : RandomForestClassifier for accurate multiclass classification. • pandas : Data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering. • Streamlit : Interactive web interface for end-user accessibility. • pickle : Model serialization for deployment.
